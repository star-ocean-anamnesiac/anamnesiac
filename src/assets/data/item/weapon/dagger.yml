    A rare event weapon since it's worth keeping. Since it is MLB it actually beats our a level 10 Golden Thunderblade due to it's ATK
    factor but the thunderblade catches back up at MLB. Has extra synergy with Nel which is worth considering if you own both daggers.
    Just a very solid weapon to have.

    The best daggers you can get from the coin shop due to them being elemental imbued. Though early on they're beaten out by the
    daggers gotten from Jie, they get better at MLB. Plus they have additional synergy with Clair which is worth considering.

    They're basically a stat stick, the third factor is bad, it's passable as a neutral weapon because of the scaling. That's it.

    A passage neutral weapon. The problem it has is the damage boosting factors are hardly uncommon anymore and the skill it boosts is
    bad. It can be of value if you're pubbing but otherwise it's just kind of average.

    Some pretty solid neutral daggers, the human slaying is not as powerful as the 40% we now see, but with a double stat boost to
    increase both damage and bulk is nice. Plus the third factor is quite a good one should you get it that far.

    An event weapon that is intended for Halloween Victor. They're pretty usable for him, AP recovery and a reasonable crit bonus. But
