    An incredible weapon. Good for both Summer Sophia and Fiore due to it's dual element boost. It has very good defensive factors on it
    with grit being strong on a healer like Summer Sophia in particular. Keep it if you pull it.

    If you haven't got an orb yet this is probably the one from the shop to go for. It's similar to winged scepter for staff users 
    except more universal since it trades buffing a skill for damage reduction, which is generally nice. The INT scaling helps make
    up for a lack of stats and getting it to MLB will give a pretty strong regen effect.

    Not a bad weapon, however the Blue Star Gadget is better, especially since there are now quite a few characters who give better 
    versions of the second and third factor in the meta, making them redundant.

    The event weapon for Summer Sophia. It's pretty good for her with some reasonable factors, buffing her main damage skill, a decent
    grit chance and a small damage buff. However there are better orbs for her so it's probably worth foddering this when you obtain
    a superior weapon.

    The factors may look good but don't let them fool you. There will be better orbs for certain characters that focus on their element.
    Against plant bosses however it is very good, and getting its 3rd factor at lb3 is a nice plus for it. Worth holding on to but
    you can do better orb wise.

    Event weapon for Fiore. Not the worst factors in the world, but you should only really use this if you don't have another orb 
    available to you.

    The BiS for Fiore. Comparing this to pumpkin may show you why pumpkin is bad. Boosts dark damage significantly while also adding a
    slighty amount of racial hate. The third factor is a nice one if you have some kind of healing in your party. Great weapon if you
    have Fiore so do keep it.

    The BiS orb for Mavelle. Has three fanatastic factors for her, boosting her Ice damage, increasing crit rate and damage and 
    eventually giving a stun rate buff. It's also passable on Fiore due to it boosting her main element of Dark slightly and also
    her off element of ice quite a bit.

    Event weapon for Mavelle. It's pretty bad, slight increase to rush damage, repel to keep aggro off you and a weak AP recovery
    on normals. Only use it if you lack anything better.
