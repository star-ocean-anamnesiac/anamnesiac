      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Perfect dodging restores AP to the party.
      
      - Strong buffs for both offense and defence.
      
      - High personal damage output, especially post-rush.
      
      - Post-rush regen gives sustain.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - HP based talents aren't consistent without setting up a proper composition.

  notes: >
      _Dias was the first defender ace we had and is rewarded by being the first defender to be awakened. Rather then try and give
      him a more all round kit like other top defenders, Dias doubles down on his composition oriented talents, in some cases
      he literally doubles them. First off we'll go over his kit. His moves are fine, a little dated but the buffs to them help
      increase damage output, on top of that he now has a big +50% self boost to his ATK. He has also gotten better at giving party
      bulk with his DEF buff now at 25% for the party and reducing ATK damage by 25% only 5% less then the best ATK damage reduction
      going._
      
      _His composition focused talents want him accompanied by only attackers and defenders, which sounds like Claude may be a good
      pick to go alongside him. No only does he provide a large 30% anti-flinch buff, he essentially replaces the sharpshooters by
      giving a 40% damage buff, matching that of base Maria._
      
      _His additional talents are underwhelming, taunt +3 should help him hold aggro and his other talent helps him regenerate health
      by holding CA. Not actively using it. Just standing there with it charging. Doing nothing. It's quite bad, but the improvements
      he gets are the real powerhouses here._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Strong party wide defensive buff.
      
      - Very good in a comp with just Attackers and defenders.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Some of his buffs are redundant for ranged characters.
      
      - Still the greatest pusher of all time.
      
      - Skill selection is a little lacklustre.

      *Normal > Annihiliating Air Slash > Double Slash > Annihiliating Air Slash > spam this until no AP - (Damage rotation)*

      _Has a wide spread of varied buffs, in addition to boasting the largest HP buff available.  Since he carries an array of watered-down buffs
      though, you'll never run into a situation where he contributes optimally.  While his awakening increased his damage output and gave him
      some nice QoL perks, it didn't do much to improve him overall._

  notes: >
      _Exists almost entirely for his rush buff, which halves damage taken and stacks additively with -ATK/INT Damage Taken, reducing most
      incoming attacks to trivial amounts.  Awakening also provides him with party Guts when he has aggro as a nice safety net.  Offensively he's
      weaker than a number of healers, both on a personal level and for what he enables for the party; fast runs with him usually hinge on tanking
      hits for faster rush gain.  Note that while his DEF+70% looks huge, his crit immunity doesn't extend to the rest of the party and crits ignore
      DEF entirely._

      _Awk4 covers all party talents aside from DEF+70%.  Awk6 adds drain on normals, aggro+3, and stronger Bloodstorm without spending a 
      single gamma._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so cheaper to augment and limit break
      
      - Great defensive buffs

      - Good rush gain
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Bloodstorm Revolution likes to send enemies skyward
      
      - No damage based buffs
