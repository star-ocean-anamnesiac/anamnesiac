      _An offensive defender who brings HP based DMG buffs, which are quite useful to have your DMG and Anti-Flinch bundled up in one unit. She still gives a bit of HP buffing for DEF, while her self buffs allow her to do significant damage as well. Unlike 2B, her perfect dodge feeds the party AP and also refreshes her own AP for easy comboing uptime. Overall a great unit._

      _[v2] Rebuffed to original JP levels. Slightly higher ATK and more equivalent to Rain uncondtionally, conditionally providing more damage and being slightly easier to manually play._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Perfect dodging restores AP to the party
      
      - Strong buffs for both offense and defence
      
      - High personal damage output, especially post-rush
      
      - Post-rush regen gives sustain.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - HP based talents aren't consistent without setting up a proper composition
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Sword 11 VS Pod 1 - S11 provides excellent DMG but is quite slow. P1 allows for a full ranged combo + speed at the cost of DPS. Preference.*

      *Normal > Pod 2 > Sword 11 > Sword 12 - DPS Close Range*

      *Normal > Pod 1 > Pod 2 > CA Sword 12 - Mixed Range*

      *CA Pod 2 > Pod 1 > Pod 2 > CA Sword 12 - DPS w/ Long Range Start*

      *(Pod 1 > Pod 2)^n - Ranged Only*

      _Starter defender, boasts high Rush Gain and is great for keeping the party alive with both his talents and his post Rush skill. For sheer defensive utility, he shouldn't be beat out too soon for his combination of talents. However, he has overall low DPS, but can loosely increase party DPS by sacrificing health for damage (Anti-Flinch). Now that he is not the sole 5★ Defender, he has begun to fall off, as he has essentially no offensive merit in both buffs and DMG._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so cheaper to augment and limit break
      
      - Great defensive buffs
      
      - Hard to kill
      
      - Good rush gain
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Bloodstorm Revolution likes to send enemies skyward
      
      - No damage based buffs

      _[v2] Our second defender comes in hot with her early buff, bringing her rush gain from terrible to mediocre (which is good), raising her damage with aggro to carry-like levels, and making her ST buff competitive with the other limited defenders. She still brings HP/INT DMG defensive bulking, which is nice for when it works, and a solid stun rate buff, which you will notice when compared to not having it. Her skillset is diverse and solid, making her a great choice again._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Anti-flinch and HP buff
      
      - Buffs herself and her party as long as she holds aggro
      
      - INT damage reduction unique to her among defenders
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Aura wall is good for hit count, but bad for damage
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Mob/Mob Stages - Thunderfire spam or Bloodstorm spam (if you can hit multiple targets). Bloodstorm may be used (its Rush Gain and DPS are similar to Aura/Air) but it is slow, can launch and is prone to miss.*

      *Normal > Aura Wall > Air Slash > Thunderfire Slash^n - (Need 4-5 AP Seeds) - DPS 

      *Air Slash > Thunderfire Slash > Air Slash > Thunderfire Slash^n - Ranged 

      *(Normal >) Aura Wall (Until Hit Count 150+) > Thunderfire^n - Rush Gain (Loses a lot of DPS.)*

      _Interesting character who also subs well into a melee-heavy/only party. He buffs DMG like a shooter, but unlike in JP at the moment, he's not too terrible compared to our shooter options. He brings respectable DMG thanks to his hefty self buffs, as well as significant defensive buffs for melee allies. Similar to sMyu, his ranged skills are quite good, but he also packs the regular Double/Air for some reliable offense. Also quite reliable when soloing, but be careful when picking him in public games, as some of his buffs are redundant with any shooter._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks.
      
      - Strong party-wide defensive buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Most of his buffs are redundant for ranged characters.
      
      - Has attacks which send enemies airborne during Elemental Burst.

      _A slightly more defensive version of A2, bringing less damage both pre and post-rush, but higher buffing overall. Dual Swords means she plays smoothly and easily. Overall, she also has a lot of personal bulk, with a damage taken redux while attacking, and a self DEF buff, in addition to her party HP/ATK Damage redux buffs. A reasonable substitute for A2, especially in pubs. Notably has a higher damage buff, though locked behind a fairly rough hitcount. Also cute as hell. Her main damage skill does lift a reasonable amount during EB._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks.
      
      - Strong party-wide defensive buffs.
      
      - Powerful offensive buffs.
      
      - Decent dps.
      
      - Good synergy with other hitcount characters.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lacks personal healing.
      
      - Helix Blade launches people.

      _A bit outscaled in his non-defender buffing, but he could be considered a NieR unit lite at this point. His extra buffing is exceeded by any unit of the correct class, but he does bring a massive 40% HP buff, and is technically pub-proof due to his nature. He also comes with Elemental DMG, which though redundant with Fayt, 2B and HMillie, is actually a very reasonable buff. His main power will be when combined with someone like Dias or XEve, to get more out of the HP bulking._

      _Now that the permanent defender pool is a bit larger, there are better options to potentially start with; that said, she's an excellent defender for newbies, stronger than the 4★ base units due to her upgrade to a non-ACE 5★. Her buffing is reasonable, though it does hurt a bit that her anti-flinch is only for healers/invokers, she does have solid sustain due to innate guts and lifesteal. Her moveset isn't the worst thing either._

      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats

      *Normal > Nether > Guillotine > Nether^n - Requires 104 AP or 5% AP Reduction*

      *(Normal >) CA Guillotine > Nether > Guillotine^n - Large targets. Guillotine lingers and racks up a ton of hits giving Miki respectable DPS.*

      _Was better than expected. His buffing is mixed, but A2 and XEve both do his damage/buffing job better. That said, he does come with debuffs which are unique, so it's not all bad. Lava Floor buffed from JP, making it a monstrous skill for damage._

  notes: >
      _[v2] Excellent awakening. Stat buffs make him a bulky monster though his mults still gimp his overall damage. ATK DMG redux and DEF at higher values make him a great defensive buffer, and a reasonable DMG buffs allows him to flex in melee/atk/def comps at the same value as unawakened Maria, which ain't bad at all. His anti-flinch is still for melee only, which blows a bit. He does pick up the ability to self-sustain, but it can be hard to find time to stand still to use it, especially as a defender with aggro. May come in handy in a pinch to reach a certain HP breakpoint in a fight._

      _[Potential] - Dias is a great autodefender, bringing bulk and easy to use/hit skills - note, you may need to use Diabolic Whirl, as the AI works strangely with ranged attacks. That said, in fights where his excellent defensive buffs are unneeded, he won't be quite as good. He also suffers against smaller bosses, and on the reverse side, excels supremely against bosses where Dragon Roar hits more than twice._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Strong party wide defensive buff.
      
      - Very good in a comp with just Attackers and defenders.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Some of his buffs are redundant for ranged characters.
      
      - Still the greatest pusher of all time.
      
      - Skill selection is a little lacklustre.

  notes: >
      _Edge wants to look good, but unfortunately his ATK buffing literally got tickled, making him a barely viable ATK buffer option with tank benefits. He may still see averagely beneficial use in auto compositions, but otherwise, his only merit is still his unparalleled HP buffing. W/o other defensive options though, it's a bit paltry. A few self talents improve his damage a bit, but without a stat buff, he doesn't shine as much as a main character should._

      _[Potential] - That said, his publord potential should not be understated. The benefits of being a jack-of-all-trades unit which make him suboptimal in premades make him good in pubs. If manual, air dodge and not getting hard smacked on CA make him viable, and discount buffing with anti-flinch beats no buffing at all. Better buff choice (ATK > DMG) but worse performance than Dias slots him slightly lower._

      **Pros**
      
      - Good variety of buffs
      
      - Incredible HP buff
      
      - Pub Lord & Good for high end single player.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lacks personal healing
      
      - Many of his buffs are easily outclassed
      
      - Lacks a range combo

      _Another powerful limited defender, Hrist pairs perfectly with her banner partner Arngrim, giving more bonuses for CA while nullifying the crit penalty for getting hit during it. Very slot efficient, bringing a source of ST damage and ATK damage, as well as being the first unit to give regular damage taken redux pre-rush. She is also the first character to have an alternate normal for her weapon type, giving her range versatility and an extended close combo. Static AP regen increase accentuates her ability to play from range, and crit and crit damage together is always appreciated heavily._

      _[Potential] Buff/slot efficiency shines in premade and pubbing, but given that nothing beats bringing almost every single damage type short of a shooter, Hrist is extremely suited to random party compositions. Range versatility and AP utlity only increase this factor._
