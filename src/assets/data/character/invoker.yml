  notes: >
      _Sophia is an interesting caster. Though she is elemental locked like all of the other casters, she also brings an ATK buffing
      skill that allows her to fit into physical attacking compositions. Due to this, if you enjoy the staff invoker play style she's
      probably the best to invest in. Her talents all buff her, and she has a homing attack that helps deal with moving targets as
      well. A viable self sufficient flexible caster._

      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Explosion > Fire Bolt > Explosion > Explosion (General damage rotation. Recommended with 101 AP.)*
      *Normal > CA Fire Bolt > Explosion > Fire Bolt (Moving target rotation.)*
