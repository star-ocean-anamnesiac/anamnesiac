      _Sophia puts on some actual clothes to join the roster as a permanent character. She's a fire caster who has one earth spell so
      is really lacking a second element. To make up for that she instead comes with an in combat ATK buff. Her talents are pretty
      greedy, affecting only her or just all healers and invokers. However this makes her self-sufficient and can just slot into
      any party as just a damage dealing fire invoker. She has an incredibly high INT stat which means she hits incredibly hard as
      well. Post rush she starts to hit even harder and her spells are reduced in cost allowing her to chain attacks together more and
      just hit like a truck.
      
      As for Sophia's negatives, well she's a staff user which means animations can be slow, she is also pretty all in on fire due
      to the lack of a secondary element. Plus aside from her ATK buffs she really is just a greedy damage dealer if she isn't in
      a caster focused composition._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - In combat ATK buff.
      
      - Good buffs for Invokers and healers.
      
      - Talents make her self sufficient and doesn't require party synergy.
      
      - Fire Bolt is a homing attack.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Talents are greedy outside of a caster composition.
      
      - Hard locked into fire. Has no real secondary element.
      
      - Staff casting.
      

      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Explosion > Fire Bolt > Explosion > Explosion (General damage rotation. Recommended with 101 AP.)*

      _Myuria was the starter Invoker choice and the second best pick behind Maria. Myuria is really the benchmark for what you're
      looking for in a damage carrying invoker. She has greedy talents that make her self sufficient, and powerful spells. Plasma
      Cyclone inparticular is a good spell for clearing trash rooms and MoT. Her secondary element is Ice, meaning she can be used
      against Michael if you really want, her main element of lightning isn't a bad one either and her boosted stun rate means she
      helps elemental burst more easily.
      
      Myuria's downsides are that she doesn't bring any talents to support the party, she is a staff caster as well so she has those
      clunky animations. She also has some pretty high AP costs and her rush gain is quite slow, especially when there aren't
      multiple targets to cyclone._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Plasma Cyclone for great AoE
      
      - Good stun rate buff.
      
      - Talents make her self sufficient and doesn't require party synergy.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Talents are greedy.
      
      - High AP costs.
      
      - Staff casting.
      
      - Slow rush gain.

      _Ronyx is a bow caster who is pretty good for buffing other INT damage dealers with his super high 40% INT buff. Post rush he
      also reduces cast time by 50% meaning he's great if you want a buffer for your caster heavy parties. His elements of choice
      are fire and earth with his focus being fire since his rush is fire based.
      
      While Ronyx may be a great buffer he's pretty garbage as a stand alone character. His cast times are slow, his stats are poor, his
      spells are expensive and his AI is utter trash. If you want a challenge, or you want to try playing a different more challenging
      play style then he's good for that but otherwise don't bother._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party wide INT buff.
      
      - Reduces cast times by 50% post rush.
      
      - Non-ace so cheaper to MLB and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Slow cast times with expensive spells which can miss.
      
      - Abysmal AI.
      
      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      _Lymle is a non-ace fire caster who is pretty average. She has greedy defensive talents that give her some bulk and her post rush
      buff lets her deal pretty respectable damage. She also has a homing attack and her main element is fire with her secondary being
      wind.
      
      Lymle's problem is that she just gets outscaled by other invokers. She's not terrible but not great either and her lack of 
      damage boosting talents hurts her quite a bit. In the end Lymle is just underwhelming, especially compared to her ace level
      competitors._

      - Mediocre damage pre-rush.

      _Faize is a strange caster because he wields a BnS. You need to get his weapon from frost tree to make him usable as well. He
      uses melee normals until we get a QoL update to give him ranged ones. Two of his spells are short ranged, but one can be used
      at long range anyway. He's locked to dark which isn't a great element, however he also applies curse which helps make up for
      his DPS. Even then his high INT stat gives him pretty good damage, especially when paired with his Rapier. He also provides
      a strong party wide single target damage buff and a stun rate buff. Plus his grit talent helps make up for how squishy he is.
      
      His downsides are there though, fact he's all in on Dark is one of them. However he is still clunky to play due to melee normals
      which can make him a challenge for newer players. He is also super squishy, with a low HP pool and crazy low defence which makes
      him even harder for newer players._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Non-ace so cheaper to MLB and augment.
      
      - Has good damage output, especially for a non-ace.
      
      - Can inflict curse.
      
      - Good party wide buffs and a grit talent to help him live.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Locked into dark.
      
      - Extremely squishy.
      
      - Melee normals and short ranged spells can make him awkward to play.

      _Celine is a bit of a different invoker compared to previous releases. For a start she focuses more on the utility side of things
      than the damage. She is an ace who buffs caster comps with a party wide INT buff. She also gives herself a rare INT damage buff
      when she has 100% HP. On top of this she has the utility of having the ability to silence foes and has plasma cyclone as her
      off element spell which gives her a good AoE option. Being a light caster has it's perks since it's one of the more frequent
      weaknesses as well.
      
      Celine does have her downsides for a start her INT buff is generally irrelevant to post rush invokers inparticular. She doesn't
      really bring anything to the party for non-casters apart from her crowd control and silencing. She doesn't do quite as much
      damage as her fellow invokers and her stronger spells are quite expensive. Plus she has the age old weakness of being a caster._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Plasma Cyclone for great AoE
      
      - Party wide INT buff for caster comps
      
      - Can silence enemies.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring much aside from her INT buff.
      
      - High AP costs.
      
      - Staff casting.

  notes: >
      _Fiore arrives to finally let players use their orb weapons as our first permanent ace orb wielder. She is a dark focused caster
      with ice as the secondary element. She provides a weak INT buff and anti-flinch on casting for caster comps. For the general 
      party she provides ATK & INT damage buffs past a 3+ skill chain. Her own talents help her chain quite a bit beyond 3 skills as
      well. Her post-rush buff lowers enemy DEF by 40% which while not amazing will benefit the parties damage a little.
      
      As for problems well, her best buff of ATK & INT damage can be hard to use for some characters, especially if they don't have AP
      reduction themselves. Dark isn't the best element to be focused on due to the lack of Dark bosses but at least Alma will be a 
      boss we'll see rerun. In the end, Fiore is a solid caster and maybe worth trying if you're interested in invokers but hate
      staff casting._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Orb casting.

      - Deals good damage.
      
      - Has homing attacks.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Dark focused caster.
      
      - Other party members may struggle to make use of her skill chain talent.

      _Claude decides to try and be just like his dear old dad and he does a pretty good job at it too. For our last freebie we get
      Ronyx V2. Claude is probably about the same power level as Ronyx so it's not amazing but he is usable. Though the INT buff isn't
      as high, 25% is still a good buff for casting compositions. He also comes with double status nullification against freeze and
      paralysis adding a MoT niche he can fill for you. Fire bolts and ice needles give him cheap spells which have tracking that
      synergise with his AP reduction talent letting him output more damage and also helping him manage with high mobility foes.
      Post rush he halfs his AP cost and reduces his casting time by 30% allowing him to dish out even further damage. Plus a 3k
      multiplier isn't terrible considering he's a free non-ace._
      
      _As for downsides, well he's Ronyx with less utility, not only is the INT buff nerfed he doesn't provide a -50% cast time 
      reduction post rush. In fact his over all party utility is niche outside of casting comps and MoT His damage will be decent
      but he's still a non=ace so his overall stats are still lacking. In summary Uniform Claude is a more playable Ronyx with less
      party buffing in exchange for being a bit more fluid and satisfying in play style.
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Great party wide INT buff.
      
      - Has spells which track enemies.
      
      - Free MLB non-ace.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lacks much utility.
      
      - Abysmal AI.
      
      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      _Mavelle is here and brings a unique playstyle to the table. Unlike other invokers Mavelle is about being a true one skill
      wonder. She sets up her damage by using Aerial Lancer and Hail orb. After this she spends her time using her Arctic Impact and
      waiting for her AP to recharge until the buffs run out and repeat. It's not a play style for everyone but it's certainly not
      a bad one if you enjoy that kind of thing. She's a damage carry and does her job well, especially on Ice weak bosses where
      she'll really pack a punch. She also does at least bring party wide AP recovery which is a nice perk to give._
      
      _Her downsides are well, she's an invoker, she will always be elemental locked and she is essentially hard locked to ice due
      to her play style. Aurora rings may as well not even be a skill in her arsenal. Also Arctic Impact comes with two issues, it
      isn't good against moving targets and it sends stunned targets into the heavens. This can make her extremely frustrating to play
      alongside and to play as. But when she's hitting those big numbers, you'll quickly find her enjoyable._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Orb casting.
      
      - Unique play style.
      
      - Deals high damage, very good against ice weak enemies.
      
      - Ap recovery buff for the party.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Locked in on Ice.
      
      - Arctic Impact can send stunned enemies up high. It can also whiff against mobile foes.

    notes: >
      _Evelysse shows up in a bridal gown as GL's first limited ace invoker. She actually hits exceptionally hard especially due to
      her 4.5k rush mult and her high multiplier on her main damage dealing attack. Post rush she gets even more powerful with her
      Int damage buff and the AP cost reduction allowed her to sling out her hard hitting spell even more. However Eve has her fair
      share of problems. She is an INT damage carry and she does deal damage well but that's all she does. She is locked to Earth
      which is probably the worst element to be locked to, but her off element of light at least offsets this a little. She uses a
      staff so her animation lock is bad and her cast reduction isn't that high on top of that. Also she's reliant on her party
      helping build up hit count to lower her AP cost. She provides on normal AP recovery to the party and that's it. The rest is
      all damage. with that buff being overshadowed already._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High damage
      
      - Ap recovery buff on normal for the party.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Earth focused.
      
      - Staff cast times with small cast reduction.
      
      - Crush is a terrible spell for your filler earth spell.
      
      - Provides almost nothing to the party. What she does give has been beaten by 3 characters.
      
      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Crush > Summon Comet > Divine Flower > Spam till out of AP (General Rotation)*
