      An incredible unit. Boasts amazing overall party utility, bringing a strong ATK buff, unconditional AP recovery on normal attacks (unlike Summer Reimi), and an incredible post-rush buff to the party. Her air dodge and evasion talents give her fluidity in a fight. Alongside all her utility, her actual damage is very solid.    
      
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party-wide ATK buff and post-rush elemental damage buff.
      
      - Unconditional AP recovery on normal attacks for the party.
      
      - Can air dodge and has cheaper evasion costs.
      
      - Innate light and dark imbue.
      
      - While her most optimal DPS is at melee, her ranged skills give her flexibility.
      
      
      **Cons**

      - ATK buff is conditional on maintaining full HP.
      
      - Self-imbue can be a downside against enemies with elemental resistances.

      Fidel, the starter character and sometime face of the app. Fidel's 40% unconditional party-wide ATK buff is still reasonable, but he gives no AP recovery from normals, which limits his utility as an attack buffer compared to units like 2B and Halloween Millie. His personal damage is not stellar, though this is mitigated to some degree by his AP reduction talent and potent post-rush buff.     
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party-wide ATK buff.
      
      - Passive AP reduction talent and even more reduction post-rush allows skill spamming.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Brings no party utility beyond his ATK buff.
      
      - Low ATK stat gives him lower damage compared to competing units.

  notes: >
      Awakened Fidel got a JP-side stealth buff, making his Air Raid much more consistent, as well as eliminating some other clunk attached to the move. With this, he now deals a significant amount of damage, allowing him to function reasonably as both an attack buffer and a carry. A solid team comp would still need to build around him (ideally adding AP recovery somewhere), but he allows flexibility and eliminates the need to rely on meeting at times fussy conditionals in order to maximize damage.

      [Potential] With his changes, Fidel becomes a pub hero, bringing his own buffing and extremely good DPS. That said, he still suffers in premades, but will do particularly well on auto, where his particular strengths shine (Air Raid hits easily, doesn't rely as heavily on AP normals, non-conditional buff).   
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong unconditional party-wide ATK buff.
      
      - Passive AP reduction talent and even more reduction post-rush allows skill spamming.
      
      - Has ranged skills which give him more flexibility.
      
      - Air Raid has high rush gain, for easy 20s rush-chaining.    
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any party utility beyond his ATK buff.

  notes: >
      Great for solo content, with dirt-cheap AP costs and a powerful rush. Notably, Fists of Fury's multi-hits linger when canceling the move, allowing Cliff to avoid committing to it and rapidly build hit count. Main weakness is that his buffs are all selfish, meaning that he brings little party utility and depends heavily on party buffs to optimize his damage output. Cliff is outscaled by other carries, and will continue to fall behind until his awakening.   
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful when party comp is built for him.
      
      - Good for solo play.   
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Completely selfish buffs; zero utility for the party.
      
      - No ranged attack.
      
      - No post-rush buff.

      Buffs critical hit chance, but brings little other party utility and has low damage output. Niche use in Crystal Guardian and against high DEF targets.   
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong passive party-wide crit buff, as well as an unmatched post-rush crit buff.
      
      - 5-star non-ace, meaning she costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5-star non-ace, meaning she has lower stats.
      
      - Poor damage and little utility beyond crit buffing.

      _His main niche is potent AP reduction; he passively provides the party -20% AP costs, which ramps up to -40% post rush. However, in caster /healer parties, a number have AP cost down passively, which lowers his efficiency there._

      _-40% AP post rush also facilitates building rush more quickly for the party, making < 20 s rush rotations effortless in some cases._

      _His DPS is brought up to above-average levels if able to utilize his human slayer talent. Later on there will be units with high DMG/AP cost that will benefit from his passive more._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful AP reduction party-wide buff
      
      - Good damage against humanoids
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his AP reduction
      
      - Bad damage against non-humanoids

      _Buffs stun rate for the party, and boasts an amazing-albeit-selfish Rush buff. Being able to chain stuns trivializes bosses, both preventing them_

      _from moving and allowing the party to unload on them without worrying about dodging, bolstering both DPS and survival. His efficiency falls_

      _off in fights that can be ended in a single rush; save him for content durable enough for Rush buffs and multiple stuns to matter. Best kept away _

      _from humanoid bosses; his performance falls off sharply if Shotgun Blast and Dragon Slash can't get bonus hits, but is significant if they do. Is still relevant today even in JP due to his ability to stun; a fantastic unit._

      **Cons**
            
      - Brings little utility beyond his stun buff
      
      - Needs some slight build around to take advantage of his buff

      _Buffed back to her JP glory, way before summer officially swings back again. Her buff becomes competitive and she is once again almost unconditionally better than even Awakened Fidel (poor guy), with a 45% ATK buff unconditionally. Her AP on normals goes back to 100%, though only for melee (admittedly a bit unfortunate) and she gets air dodge, making her Helmsplit much more usable [SUMMER SMOOTHIE]. SReimi returns. Although her moveset is still a bit subpar, there's nothing particularly terrible about it._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK buffs.
      
      - Ap recovery on normals for close-ranged fighters.
      
      - Really powerful post-rush buff.
      
      - Rush combo damage buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Slow rush gain.
      
      - Awkward attack buff.
      
      - Subpar moveset.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Can run Combo Breaker in the place of Smackdown for less AP, slightly less smooth comboing (bit slower), but more Rush Gain.*

      _At the current time, Lenneth looks to be a direct side-downgrade from sReimi and Fidel. Her damage and rush gain is nothing to write home about, being about on par with sReimi, and you lose the convenience of AP RCV on melee units, traded for her chance to Silence; Silence may occasionally stop a boss pattern from doing something annoying (or it can promote a more dangerous pattern). At best, a reasonable replacement, unless she gets buffs, will not be amazing; viable if lacking other ATK buffers._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unconditional good ATK buff
      
      - Rush combo damage buff
      
      - Defence debuff on rush for enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - ATK buff has been exceeded by many attackers making it redundant in a lot of comps
      
      - Silence has a low chance to apply making it a poor talent that doesn't do much
      
      - Doesn't do enough other attackers don't already do better

  notes: >
      _Claude is an interesting unit for this time in the game, as he scales well with good, strong attackers and gets worse with good shooters. 50% will be the highest ATK buff in the GL at this release, but unfortunately having three other ATK buffers makes him less of a priority and less interesting overall comparatively. It is worth noting that GL has merits (buffed weapons, early summer units, possibly earlier other limited units) which makes him much stronger compared to JP. In a pre-made comp built properly (melee, no shooters), should shine beautifully, but requires that. Notable for unconditional AP RCV, so even in a team with a shooter, he still has a bit of utility. May still be worth running in 3/1 to let the shooter have no AP regen downtime._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful ATK buff for attackers and defenders.
      
      - Damage reduction for healers.
      
      - Ap recovery on Normals.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Poor synergy with sharpshooters and invokers.
      
      - Post-rush buff made redundant by commonly seen characters like Maria and 9S.

  notes: >
      _Ranged Cliff, and should have similar performance. She has only selfish buffs, with no party utility to speak of besides the potential for Freeze (which only guarantees a single Crit). She has a good skillset and her buffs aren't common pre-Rush buffs, which means they don't overlap as much with Maria/SMiki & other Crit buffers. She does interestingly have a -DEF debuff in compensation for her huge self buffs, but her DEF is quite low anyway. Don't get hit._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High damage output.
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      - Can freeze enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Provides nothing to the rest of the party.
      
      - Glass cannon so not new player or new content friendly.

  notes: >
      _A bit interesting, though on GL release will not be as stellar as he was on JP. In general stronger weapons and better access to certain buffs mean that Albel, while being a decent mix of a DPS and buffer, doesn't do either extremely well. His damage is gated by being someone who focuses on Air Slash, and his main ATK buff only applies to Attackers and Defenders, like Claude. Unlike Claude, DEF down matters little when the enemies are weaker, only adding a minor DMG increase, while Claude's unconditional AP on normals increases uptime for the whole team._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent variety of buffs
      
      - High post rush damage
      
      - Rare debuffing of enemy talent
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Super squishy post rush
      
      - Buffs are easily made redundant
      
      - Not the best skill options

  notes: >
      _Not terrible, provides an average ATK buff considering her other utility. She's meant to synergize with Invokers on maps with trash, but realistically most maps which have mobs don't really need the multi-target DMG, and most bosses come alone otherwise. For the exact composition she would support (Fire Invokers) her ATK buff is useless. Overall extremely poor synergy. If you have no other ATK buffer, she fills the role, but if you have literally any other ATK buffer, they're probably better._

      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Buffs aren't really that relevant outside of niche comps and content
      
      - ATK buff is overshadowed by many other attackers

      _HClair makes off with the weakest of the unnerfs, only getting a slight increase in ATK and her ATK DMG buffs. That said, this aligns her again with new modern levels of power, making her damage extremely solid. She is still a reasonable source of ATK DMG, especially pre-rush, and her post-rush buff isn't the worst thing, bulking while also adding a smidge of extra damage._

      _Awoo makes her great return, with excellent unconditional buffing and a very reasonable 100 HC for her max buffing. Again, notably is less strict than 2B once her HC is reached, due to the team not being required to play around being full HP. The DMG unnerf puts her back to reasonable levels with the other unnerfed units. The only thing which holds her back at all is that GL is still a bit slow to reach even regular levels of HC._

      _The boy himself, who should've been a decent ATK buffer, was unfortunately powercrept before his release. Although he comes bundled with a few choice things, such as pre-Rush Elemental DMG, overall his lower ATK buff and lack of AP RCV like the limited units makes him less appealing comparatively. That said, once the limited units are not available anymore, he is fairly reasonable, with his free elemental buff making up for a bit of the damage his ATK buff loses. He does also give a slight Anti-Flinch to ranged units and comes with free imbue._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent ATK buff
      
      - Double self imbue
      
      - Passive elemental damage buff
      
      - Awooo
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Has no ranged attack
      
      - Needs certain weapons against bosses with elemental resist
      
      - His anti-flinch is pretty useless at this point

      _Convince your teammates to die for you. Michael is an interesting character, with the specific unique ability that lets him get stronger as your teammates die. Unfortunately, he suffers from long skills and subpar buffs. His 40 would be nice, but it's only for Attackers, and he's at his strongest when he has no other teammates, which is unintuitive. He would be decent for pubs and soloing, but his skill lengths do hinder this quite a bit and making kiting hard. Worth noting that he does count towards his own buff, and it persists through revives, gems or otherwise._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unique design
      
      - Decent ATK buff for attackers
      
      - Deals decent damage
      
      - Really good against fire weak bosses
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Has no ranged attack
      
      - Needs people to die to be effective
      
      - Needs elemental imbue knuckles if enemy resists fire
            
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Pyroclast is the cheapest move, Bosom is the fastest, Fire Fest is the highest DPS/rush gain unless Lava Flow is viable.*

      *Normal > Pyroclast > Bosom > Fest / Lava > (Dodge if using Lava)*

      _Hitcount based carry who can self-sustain himself even with no other ATK buffer present. Respectable hitcount racking on his main skill, long range and quick-deploying skills make him easy and safe to play at range. Mobility of Dual Guns will take getting used to, but can be used to avoid many attacks mid-combo, with the caveat of sometimes losing DPS as well due to not wanting to move in a direction. Gets a boost at SC3/5, and his personal rush buff lasts basically indefinitely once he gets it the first time, due to the 30s timer._

      _A selfish carry, like Cliff, but actually does have some minor party buffing, unlike Cliff. Should be slightly better, and also scales a bit better with hitcount. Not amazing compared to the limited carries, but should be reasonable for a while, especially as a permanent unit._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Does a good amount of damage
      
      - Some weak utility to the party
      
      - Works well with hit counter characters if no ATK buffer
      
            
      **Cons**
            
      - Party Utility is weak without the right characters
      
      - If no ATK buffer it requires a high hit count to get the most out of her
            
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Don't be fooled by Claws' hit count and damage, it's very very slow and should only be used during burst as a combo ender.*

      *Normal > Crescent > Spike > CA Crescent - DPS & Hit Count*

      *Normal > Crescent > Spike > CA Claws - Combo during EB to avoid disruption.*

      _Free Fidel. He actually has solid ATK buffing, with some minor other benefits. In a sense, he's probably actually close to discount Claude, but overall he's a great attack buffer for anyone who doesn't have one already. Solid even compared to some units we have already. Minor talent buffs, significant multiplier buffs from JP, making him more viable damage-wise too._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong unconditional ATK buff, that gets even better for melee characters.
      
      - Nullifies annoying movement fields for melee.
      
      - Free MLB Ace
      
      - Innate Ice Imbue attacks
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Does little for ranged characters
      
      - Gives no AP recovery unlike other buffers
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Storm vs Haze (Double Slash) - Personal preference. Haze does a minimal amount more DPS, but Storm is significantly faster, which means more time to dodge, etc. 

      *Normal > Storm > Tranq > Flash^n*

      *Normal > Storm > Tranq > Flash^n > CA Storm - 105 AP Required; Less downtime due to mitigating Flash's backstep.*

      _A carry with a unique debuff. Should avoid significant nerfs if nerfs, may possibly get some buffs, quite useful due to her nature. Interesting party utility as well with AP cost redux at SC3. It will be hard to work around this as an ally, but she can maintain it for a few seconds due to her low AP costs. Her skills are notoriously slow and her rush gain can be unreliable, so consider this the tradeoff for her buffs. Monster rush._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Brings a lot of damage
      
      - Some weak utility to the party
      
      - Unique debuffs to enemies
      
            
      **Cons**
            
      - Slow attacking animations
      
      - Slow Rush gain
            
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Magnetic > CA Arm > (Rocket/Magnetic)^n*

      *All of vVerda's skills can be CA'd for repositioning. Rocket and Magnetic can come down to preference. Magnetic Field has a longer animation time, but can be better with mobile and small targets due to higher area coverage.*

      _VRena is hard to value. On one hand, she doesn't have AP recovery for anyone but attackers. On the other hand, she has the highest attack buff in the game for melee units. Paired with a carry or another AP recovery attacker, she is amazing. Even then, the sheer damage output of the team should just be too high to ignore. Higher ST rush buff helps a bit._

      _[Potential] - VRena is hard to build around - with melee units, she only provides AP on normals to Attackers, which means either you play without it or skip out on other roles, which lowers your overall damage output. The best AP-normal unit at time of writing, 2B, now has equal buffing to her, which means most of the important things VRena does are unneeded._

      _Melee XFidel. Has her own ATK buff, a very high base ATK, and some respectable buffing for melee units. She also comes innately with some crit at 100% HP. Otherwise a pretty standard carry with some good self-sustain. Nothing particularly special about her. Does have disruption during EB, so be careful._

      **Cons**
      
      - Buff conditions require being built around or are inconsistent.
      
      - Lack of a ranged attack can cause issues with cetain bosses.

      _Ashton's party buffing looks pretty bad, and that's because it is - he's a carry, so don't be fooled. Pre-rush elemental damage helps him make the most of his imbued elements, and as a bonus he basicially has two free imbues. Hitcount racking, a bunch of cool self-buffs for using his rotation, and a solid post-rush. Other carries may bring more, but he's a solid force to be reckoned with._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong Elemental and Rush damage buff.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      - Has both a ranged and melee combo.
      
      - Fun playstyle.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Elemental damage buff gets overwritten by a lot of characters post rush. Some of which are extremely popular.
      
      - Rush damage buff requires high hit count to get the best from it.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Piercing > Twin > Northern^n*

      *Normal > Piercing > Twin > Dance^n*

      *Normal > Northern > Piercing > Northern^n > Sword Dance (Dash cancel Sword Dance after the first hits contact.)*

  notes: >
      _WRena is a spread buffer who suffers from subpar buffing. That said, her GL exclusive buff gave her AP on normals, which is one of the most important buffs for most parties. This sets her as a sidegrade to HMillie, with a notable bonus being her regen, which is enough to recover a significant amount of health before rush. Her moveset is quite bad, with her version of Chariot being uncancelable unlike Cliff's, and nothing else doing notable damage.Her personal buffs make up for this a bit._

      **Pros**
      
      - Strong Party wide HP regen

      - Big rush multiplier.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Awful ATK and Single Target damage buff.
      
      - What kind of post rush buff is that?

      **TL DR**
      
      _In real talk, she's pretty below-average. Mostly unimpressive damage, especially compared to limited carries, with almost non-existent buffing otherwise. She has a regen rush, but doesn't merit the slot or level of healing to use her for that purpose either. Outscaled even not considering the GL level of powercreep without some GL exclusive buffs. Her only saving grace is some decent mults in addition to her selfish buff._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Post Rush Regen.
      
      - Long Hit Count Extension
      
      - Big rush multiplier.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Awful ATK stat coupled with a conditional self buff.
      
      - Utility is quite weak.
   
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Rocket > Field > Rocket > Field^n - HC*

      *Normal > Rocket > Slammer > Jump 'n' Thump^3*

      *Normal > Rocket > Field > Jump 'n' Thump^3 - 104 AP Required, but can be done with 100 AP by starting w/ ranged and CAing into Thumps.*

      *Normal > Field > Rocket > Field > Rocket^n - Long Ranged (AP seeded yields an extra Rocket.)*

      _As a pure carry, Crowe's damage isn't bad. He's fast, fun and incentivizes back attacks for extra power. His rush looks a bit strange, but it gives him a short amount of high DPS burst (and its low time means you only need to get off the one combo). To add on to this, he does bring his own ATK buff, making him pubproof. That said, given his restriction, he's never going to be efficient as a buffer alone._

      _Our final non-ace release, and she has a single niche as a utility unit - rush feeding. This is unique to her until some future units come, so she functionally does what Daril does, trading extra 300% combo damage slightly more rush uptime and sub 20 rush rotations (which can benefit from rush buffs). She has terrible damage by herself, but her rush buff is notably higher than any shooter damage buff. Dragon feeds 5% rush bar regardless of character, regardless of whether it hits or not. She also does have AP on norms, though locked behind 100% HP._

  notes: >
      _"Dead Ends things harder than some characters rush for." Even with all the strange GL releases, Arngrim brings one of the highest DPS numbers to date, with fairly fast and extremely powerful rotations. DEF down is not amazing, but when lacking innate crit, does come in handy, and is almost guarnateed to be unique in a party. His main shortcoming is that he needs to CA to achieve maximum output, but mitigates this with a huge 95/30 guts. In a pinch, he does have a heal on holding his CA (just charge and don't release) but it takes 6 seconds to achieve guts % HP back, making it very situational. Postrush guaranteed crit makes him a great choice for high difficulty content to bust through the inflated stats._

      _Innately does Light/Fire damage.  Buffs both ATK and attribute damage, but his ATK buff is low and his attribute buffing isn't unique.
      Awakening similarly didn't boost his skills by as much as it needed to; he takes a lot of investment for a subpar ATK buffer._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent ATK buff
      
      - Double self imbue
      
      - Passive elemental damage buff
      
      - Awooo
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Has no ranged attack
      
      - Needs certain weapons against bosses with elemental resist
      
      - His anti-flinch is pretty useless at this point
